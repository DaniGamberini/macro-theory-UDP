Required Software
========================================================

You should install the following software:

## **R** and *RStudio*
**R** is the language and comes with a functional console and a simple GUI in the case of Windows. But to make your life simpler and to author documents for this class, you'll be using a wonderful work enviroment for **R**, called RStudio.

+ Go to http://cran.r-project.org/ and follow the download link for your OS (Windows, Linux or MacOS X)

+ Install **R** 

+ Go to http://www.rstudio.org/ , download and install RStudio

+ Once installed, open **RStudio** as Administrator (in Windows, right-click on R, then choose the option Run as Administrator; in Linux, do sudo R), go to the *Packages* tab, click on *Install Packages* and type *ctv*. This will install the *ctv* package. Next, load the package by typing `library(ctv)` in the Console or by checking the box next to ctv in the Packages list.

+ After loading `ctv`, type  in the console this command `install.views(c("Econometrics", "ReproducibleResearch"))`. This will install two Task Views. While you computer downloads and installs them, take the time to visit the Task View pages on Cran: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ . In particular, don't miss to see the pages for Econometrics and Reproducible Research

+ Be thankful for the people behind these Task Views, just go to this page and see how many packages are in Cran!: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/

+ Familiarize yourself with the existence of R manuals and the help pages for every package. In addition, RStudio comes with a set of nice and concise Docs, and there several video tutorials for both R and RStudio. Take a few minutes to discover some of them. One site worth exploring is http://www.r-bloggers.com/

## **Git** and **Github**

Let me introduce you to a great little thing: Git ... and Github, which is fairly neat, too. In its own words, Git is "free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency". Github it's an internet site with lots of features to make your life easier when working with Git. So you should 

+ If you are working on windows, I suggets you download github's native app and run it to set up everything it's a breeze: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows . If you are in Linux, follow the instructions in https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux

+ Now, go to https://github.com/ricardomayerb/macro-theory-UDP and just clone this repository (macro-theory-udp). This should create new folders in your PC.
