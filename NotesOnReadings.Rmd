[1] David Moss: A concise guide to Macroeconomics **[DM]**
------------

Very useful for a quick reminder of the basics or for a crash course for people coming from other disciplines. You'll find no equations and only the simplest arithmetic. Like most texts in macro, however, it reflects the state of macro before the 2008-2009 financial crisis and it's inevitable to seriously miss more references to financial and solvency issues.

You should read first half of the book during the first week and the second part of the book during the second week. This is:

 1. **August 09**, Reading Test #1 : Part I of **[DM]**, "Understanding the Macro Economy", pages 5 to 84
     + Output, 7-32
     + Money, 33-66
     + Expectations, 67-83
 
 2. **August 16**, Reading Test #2: Part II of **[DM]**, "Selected Topics -- Background and Mechanics", pages 85 to 142
     + A short history of money and monetary policy in the Unites States, 87-98
     + The fundamentals of GDP accounting, 99-114
     + Reading a Balance of Payments statement, 115-124
     + Undersanding exchange rates, 125-132
     + Conclusion, 133-142
