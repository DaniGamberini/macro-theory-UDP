#Macroeconomic Theory

###Southern Spring 2012 

- Week 2: 

- Output, inflation and stabilization

- static models: K-cross, IS-LM, AD-AS

- First version: 2012/08/12, this version: 2012/08/12


#Undergrad staples

- Keynesian cross: all dependencies are on $Y_t$

- IS-LM: Adds real interest rate as an AD's determinant

- AD-AS: relax fixed aggregate price, mantains fixed *nominal* wages.

- Declining real wages imply positive slope of AS curve. 

- Declining $M/P$ implies negative slope for AD curve


#Phillips Curve

- We need to look at the evolution of wages

- Phillips 1958: stable relation between (log)wage increases and level of unemployment:
   $$
   \dot{w}_t = \Phi(u_t), \quad \Phi(u^{*}) = 0, \quad \Phi' < 0
   $$
   
- $u^{*} > 0$. Why? Known as NIRU or NRU. 

- Practice drawing an $(x,y)$ diagram with $(u, \dot{w})$.

- Friedman and Phelps:
   $$
   \dot{w}_t = \phi_{t}^{e} +  \Phi(u_t), \quad \Phi(u^{*}) = 0
   $$
