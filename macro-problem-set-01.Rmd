Problem Set 1
========================================================

## Exercise 1
Let's solve, for the Cobb-Douglas case, the differential equation that describes the dynamics of (per capita) capital accumulation. If the production function is given by $Y_t = A K_t^\alpha L_t^{1-\alpha}$, and in per capita terms by $y_t = A k_t^{\alpha}$, then the DE is :

$$
\begin{equation}\label{kdiffeq}
\dot{k}_t = s k_t^{\alpha} - (n + \delta) k_t
\end{equation}
$$


1. Put the DE in standard form: $\frac{d y}{d x} + P(x) y = Q(x)$.


2. Solve the equation in standard form, using the Integrating Factor technique that you saw in class.


3. Transform your solution to give a solution for $k_t$.
