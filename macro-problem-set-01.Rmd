Problem Set 1
========================================================

## Exercise 1: Solow-Swan's differential equation

Let's solve, for the Cobb-Douglas case, the differential equation that describes the dynamics of (per capita) capital accumulation. If the production function is given by $Y_t = A K_t^\alpha L_t^{1-\alpha}$, and in per capita terms by $y_t = A k_t^{\alpha}$, then the DE is :

$$
\begin{equation}\label{kdiffeq}
\dot{k}_t = s k_t^{\alpha} - (n + \delta) k_t
\end{equation}
$$


1. Put the DE in standard form: $\frac{d y}{d x} + P(x) y = Q(x)$.


2. Solve the equation in standard form, using the Integrating Factor technique that you saw in class.


3. Transform your solution to give a solution for $k_t$.

## Exercise 2: Cobb-Douglas production functions with either labor augmenting , capital augmenting or neutral productivity.

1. Simple: write all three versions of the C-D function. Use $A$ for neutral productivity, $B$ for labor augmenting productivity and $C$ for the capital augmenting one. 

2. Show that both $B$ and $C$ can be written as one-to-one functions of $A$. 

## Exercise 3: FOCs in a CES with many inputs

1. **Discrete case**. Let $P$ be the price of output and $P_i$ the prices of each input. Show that, if the production function is given by,

\[
Y = N \left( \frac{1}{N} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} X_i^\eta \right)^{1/\eta} 
\]

the profit maximization implies
\[
\frac{N X_i}{Y} = \left( \frac{P_i}{P}  \right)^{-1/(1-\eta)} 
\]

1. **Continuum case**. Let $P$ be the price of output and $P_i$ the prices of each input. Show that, if the production function is given by,

\[
Y = N \left( \int_0^1 X_i^\eta \right)^{1/\eta} 
\]

the profit maximization implies
\[
\frac{X_i}{Y} = \left( \frac{P_i}{P}  \right)^{-1/(1-\eta)} 
\]
